This repository includes code and resources for analyzing time series data and predicting the future price of gold using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The ARIMA model is a robust approach used in forecasting and trend analysis that combines autoregression, integration, and moving average components to capture the patterns in the data. This repository provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the ARIMA model in Python and includes sample code and data sets for testing the accuracy of the predictions. The code is accompanied by detailed documentation and tutorials to facilitate understanding and use. Whether you are new to time series analysis or a seasoned researcher, this repository provides a valuable resource for exploring and applying the ARIMA model to a wide range of applications.

## DATASET  


The project presents a comprehensive analysis of historical gold prices and the implementation of the ARIMA model to predict the future price of gold. The data utilized is obtained from reputable sources and includes various features such as date, opening price, high price, low price, closing price, change in pips, and percentage change.

## ANALYZING THE DATA 
The ARIMA model is created and trained using the historical gold price data. The optimal values for the ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) are determined through techniques like grid search or auto-correlation plots. The code for this process is available on the repository and is accompanied by tutorials and documentation.
